cd /root
kubectl delete all --all
git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
cd /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications
kubectl apply -f .
kubectl get all
kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-lpwcl
Container ID has changed, app is working.
kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-rsm8r
Container ID has changed, app is working.
kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-6gkhf
Result app lost connection to the db, after refreshing the page results are 50.0% : 50.0%. Vote app is working, but any change doesn't reflect in result app. Worker pod shows 1 restart.
kubectl logs pod/db-b54cd94f4-ppr98
kubectl exec --stdin --tty result-5d57b59f4b-kfz64 -- bash
kubectl logs pod/result-5d57b59f4b-kfz64
(Error performing query: Error: This socket has been ended by the other party)
Three ways how to get app working again:
1) kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-kfz64
2) kubectl scale deployment result --replicas=0
   kubectl scale deployment result --replicas=1
3) kubectl rollout restart deployment result
A possible improvement is to store db's data on a persistent volume. Results won't be lost after Pod restart.
